#  RISC-V_SoC_Tapeout_Program_VSD_Kashish_Agarwal
This repository tracks my week-by-week progress in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, detailing tasks and learning experiences.

## About the Program
This program provides a hands-on journey to design, implement, and fabricate a RISC-V SoC. It is designed for students, educators, and professionals to gain end-to-end chip development experience, from RTL design to post-silicon validation. It is part of India’s Semiconductor Mission, aiming to train skilled silicon designers who go beyond simulation to actual tapeout, in collaboration with IIT Gandhinagar, VLSI System Design and the Semiconductor Laboratory.

### Week 0 —  Getting Started
- Introduction to Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning
- Installation and configuration of the open-source EDA toolchain: Yosys, Icarus Verilog (iVerilog), etc.
